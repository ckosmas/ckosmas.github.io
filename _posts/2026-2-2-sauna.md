**Information Gathering:** 

The first step taken was to run a scan against the vulnerable machine to identify all of the open ports and services present.

Autorecon, which is an automated recon script, was utilized for this task. To learn more about the commands AutoRecon runs under the hood such as the nmap command below, please visit the link in the references section.

```
nmap -vv --reason -Pn -A --osscan-guess --version-all -p- 10.10.10.175
```
